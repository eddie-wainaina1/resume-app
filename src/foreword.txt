Learning has always been a major part of my life. It is one of those things that
just awakens the best in me, one of the things that I really enjoy. Applying the
knowledge I have gained is among the things that give me pleasure and
encourage me to wake up every morning. Close to that are the opportunities to apply
this knowledge and the ability to learn something new.
