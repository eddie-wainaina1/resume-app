It is one of those things that just awakens the best in me, one of the \
things that I really enjoy. Applying theknowledge I have gained is among \
the things that give me pleasure and encourage me to wake up every morning. \
Close to that are the opportunities to apply this knowledge and the ability to \
learn something new.`

to get me out of my comfort zone is a welcome. \
I like growth, evolution and opportunities for that happening in my, and other \

I would prefer to live in a world where innovation is made easy and not bombarded \
by unnecessary bureaucracies. One where there is always room to move forward in all \
aspects of life.`
